# [Kadscan](https://www.kadscan.io/)

==========

## Guidelines

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature") and the imperative mood ("Move class to..." not "Moves class to...") on commits and use the name issue on pull requests.
- Pull requests must be reviewed before merged.
- Done is better than perfect. Does it work as expected? Ship now, iterate later.
- All contributions must have tests. Remember to verify the [Github Actions CI status](https://github.com/hack-a-chain-software/indexer-kadena/actions/workflows/CI.yaml).
- Every commit is checked using [Github Actions](https://github.com/hack-a-chain-software/indexer-kadena/actions).
- If the CI status are not passing, the deploy will not work.
