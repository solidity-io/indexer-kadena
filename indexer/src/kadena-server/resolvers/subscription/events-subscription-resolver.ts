 * which allows clients to receive real-time updates when specific types of events are
 * emitted on the blockchain. It uses an AsyncGenerator to continuously poll for new events
 * and push them to subscribed clients.

/**
 * AsyncGenerator function that continuously polls for new events
 *
 * This function creates a polling loop that checks for new events matching the specified
 * criteria at regular intervals. It keeps track of the last seen event ID to avoid
 * sending duplicate events to subscribers.
 *
 * The function supports filtering events by:
 * - Qualified event name (module.name format)
 * - Chain ID
 * - Minimum confirmation depth
 *
 * @param context - Resolver context containing repositories and control signals
 * @param qualifiedEventName - The qualified name of events to monitor (module.name format)
 * @param chainId - Optional chain ID to filter events by specific chain
 * @param minimumDepth - Optional minimum confirmation depth for events
 * @returns AsyncGenerator that yields arrays of new events as they are discovered

 * - resolve: Transforms the data from the AsyncIterator into the format expected by the GraphQL schema
 *
 * The resolver allows clients to monitor events by qualified name with optional filters
